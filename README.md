# Library Management System - Back-end (Java)

This repository contains the *back-end* of the Library Management System, built using *Java* and *Spring Boot. It provides the REST API for managing authors, books, and reviews, with **CRUD* functionality for each entity.

## Project Overview

The back-end handles three main entities:
1. *Author*: Create and manage author details.
2. *Book*: Create and manage books, each linked to an author.
3. *Review*: Add and manage reviews for books.

The project is well-structured to integrate with the front-end, providing RESTful APIs and handling data persistence via a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used

- *Spring Boot*: Back-end framework
- *MySQL*: Database for storing authors, books, and reviews
- *Maven*: Dependency management
